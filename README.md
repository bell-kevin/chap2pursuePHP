# chap2pursuePHP

Create a form that takes some input from the user, then create the PHP script that validates the form data and reports upon the results.  Use the form reservations.html in Pacific Trails Case Study from SDEV 1022.

      Hint: Your file will need to be PacificTrails.php and runs with the URL: http://localhost/PacificTrails.php

 Rewrite handle_form.php (Script 2.4) to:
 
 ![o](https://github.com/bell-kevin/chap2pursuePHP/blob/main/form.PNG)
 
Rewrite the gender conditional  as one conditional instead of two nested ones. Hint: Youâ€™ll need to use the AND operator.
Use $_POST instead of $_REQUEST.
Validate the age element. Hint: Use the $gender validation as a template, this time checking against the corresponding pull-down option values (0-29, 30-60, 60+).

Submission: Submit a zip file containing your two PHP scripts; in addition submit .PNG screenshots that demonstrate each part of these scripts running in a browser window.
